# Flutter - Study Projects

Hello everyone!

Here you'll find my code regarding my flutter studies!

## Udemy - Academind Course Files

On Udemy Academind Course Files, you'll find my projects done in the Udemy Course: Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide \[2020 Edition\] (https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) by Academind by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller

The files are sorted by the sections of the course.

### Section 1: Introduction

  Here you'll find my first Hello World, along with a default project created for analysis

### Section 2: Quiz App and Assignment

  Here you'll find my first Flutter app under 'flutter_complete_guide'. It's a quiz app, that will show your results at the end!

  You'll also find a project with an assignment from the course, this was built by me, to test the knowledge acquired in this section.
